# DIG (Dynamical Information Geometry)


DIG is a method for visualizing high dimensional dynamical processes 

Based on the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2019.8918875). Additionally, a brief explanation about this method can be found in `DIG_poster.pdf`. 

For any use of DIG, please cite

### Requirements

The [PHATE](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/PHATE/tree/master/Python) package is required. 

### Demo notebooks 

There is a [Python demo](https://github.com/KevinMoonLab/DIG/blob/master/DIG_python/EEG_demo.ipynb) and a [Matlab demo](https://github.com/KevinMoonLab/DIG/blob/master/DIG_matlab/demo_EEG.pdf) on how to use DIG.
