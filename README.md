# DIG (Dynamical Information Geometry)


DIG is a method for visualizing high dimensional dynamical processes 

Based on the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10725). Additionally, a brief explanation about this method can be found in `DIG_poster.pdf`. 

### Requirements

[PHATE](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/PHATE/tree/master/Python) package is required. 

### Jupyter notebooks 

There is a [Python demo](https://github.com/KevinMoonLab/DIG/blob/master/DIG_python/EEG_demo.ipynb) and a [Matlab demo] (https://github.com/KevinMoonLab/DIG/blob/master/DIG_matlab/demo_EEG.pdf) on how to use DIG.
